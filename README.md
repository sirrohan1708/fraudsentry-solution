## Technical Capabilities

### Graph Analytics Implementation
- Fraud ring detection through coordinated network analysis
- Device fingerprint collision detection for impossible hardware sharing
- Temporal impossibility analysis for physically impossible transactions
- Behavioral signature matching using neural pattern recognition

### Chargeback Intelligence System
- AI classification engine for dispute categorization (friendly fraud, genuine disputes, true fraud)
- Win probability prediction using machine learning models
- Automated evidence package generation for dispute responses
- ROI optimization through cost-benefit analysis for each chargeback

### Enterprise Integration
- API-first architecture for seamless integration with existing fraud systems
- Enhancement layer compatible with FICO, SAS, IBM, and Featurespace platforms
- Real-time processing with sub-second fraud detection responses
- Scalable infrastructure supporting enterprise-level transaction volumes
